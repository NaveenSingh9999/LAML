# LAML Phase 3 - Enhanced Developer Experience

Welcome to LAML Phase 3! This release focuses on polishing the developer experience with enhanced readability, debugging capabilities, and visual clarity.

## 🎯 Phase 3 Features

### 📝 Comments System

LAML now supports two types of comments:

#### Single-line Comments
```laml
~ This is a single-line comment
val x = 42; ~ Inline comment
```

#### Multi-line Comments
```laml
{~ 
   This is a multi-line comment
   that spans multiple lines
   Perfect for documentation blocks
~}
```

### 🎨 Syntax Highlighting Support

Phase 3 includes VS Code extension files for full syntax highlighting support:

- **Keywords** (bring, val, func, etc.): Blue
- **Strings**: Green  
- **Numbers**: Orange
- **Constants**: Purple
- **Functions**: Cyan
- **Errors**: Red

### 🖼️ File Icon Integration

- `.lm` files display with the LAML logo icon
- Integrated into VS Code and other editors
- Professional visual branding

### ⚠️ Enhanced Console Output

Styled console messages with emoji indicators:

```
🚀 LAML Compiler - [filename.lm]
=====================================
[ℹ️ INFO] Compiling and executing...
[✅ DONE] @ line 30 :: Function 'deploy' executed
[⛔ ERROR] @ line 12 :: Unset constant 'max_threads'
```

### 🔧 Compiler UX Upgrades

- Styled title bar with filename
